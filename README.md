# Welcome to CBBio - Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Lab

## About Us

Welcome to the GitHub organization for CBBio, the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics lab currently located at the Andalusian Center for Developmental Biology (CABD). Founded in 2009 in Barcelona and relocated to Seville in 2013, our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of computational biology and bioinformatics through rigorous research and innovation.

Our team comprises a diverse group of biologists, bioinformaticians, and engineers who are passionate about using computational methods to unravel the complexities of biological systems. Our research focuses on understanding protein evolution, function, multifunctionality, and the impact of mutations on protein function. We are also committed to improving the automatic annotation of protein functions to facilitate broader scientific discoveries.

## Achievements

- More than 60 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, invited reviews, and over 50 oral presentations at national and international venues.
- Recipient of the prestigious Maria de Maeztu award, recognizing our lab as an excellence center/unit from the SOMMa alliance.

## Research Interests

- **Protein Evolution:** Tracing the origins and evolutionary trajectories of proteins.
- **Protein Function:** Investigating how proteins function and their multifunctional roles in biological processes.
- **Mutation Impact:** Assessing how mutations affect protein function and contribute to disease.
- **Protein Function Annotation:** Developing computational methods for the automatic annotation of protein functions.

## Publications

Our lab has contributed to numerous publications in high-impact journals, covering a wide range of topics within computational biology and bioinformatics. For a detailed list of our publications, please visit our [Publications](#) page.
